## Current Tech Stack

The new version of MyBusTimes is powered by:

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime environment for building scalable and fast server-side applications.
- **EJS**: A templating engine that lets me embed JavaScript into HTML to create dynamic pages.
- **Django Rest Framework**: A powerful toolkit for building Web APIs in Python, making it easy to serve data to the frontend.
