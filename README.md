# Hi, I'm Kai

**Pronouns:** They/Them

## About Me

I'm the developer behind [MyBusTimes](https://mybustimes.cc) - a project built in the style of [BusTimes.org](https://bustimes.org) that allows people to create their own fleets and manage their virtual bus companies.

V2 is now released in its **final form**, featuring a range of new tools and integrations:

### New Features in V2

* **Messaging:** Webhooks (still experimenting/learning)
* **Ticket System:** Full integration with Discord
* **Forum:** Syncs with Discord
* **For Sale Page:** New marketplace-style page
* **Customisable Helper Permissions**
* **RTT (Real Time Tracking)**
* **Wiki:** Fully custom-built wiki system
* **Custom Admin Dashboard**

Outside of MyBusTimes, I’ve also been getting into **web development for others**. So far, I’ve built websites for two people and I’m currently working on a third.
