## About Me

I'm the developer behind [MyBusTimes](https://mybustimes.cc), a website build of the back of BusTimes.org to allow people to create there own fleets and manage there virual bus company. Currently, I'm working on new version of MyBusTimes that is being built with more modern technologies.

## Current Tech Stack

The new version of MyBusTimes is powered by:

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime environment for building scalable and fast server-side applications.
- **EJS**: A templating engine that lets me embed JavaScript into HTML to create dynamic pages.
- **Django Rest Framework**: A powerful toolkit for building Web APIs in Python, making it easy to serve data to the frontend.
